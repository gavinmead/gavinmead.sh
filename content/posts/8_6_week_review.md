Enjoyed a week of relaxation at the beach. I want to do something similar to the Tim Ferriss 5 Bullet Friday where I share stuff that I found interesting this past week.

Podcasts I enjoyed:
* [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2023/08/10/dustin-moskovitz-2/) episode with Dustin Moskovitz.  I'm playing around with the time budget google sheet template.
* The Ethan Hawke episode of [Armchair Expert](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/ethan-hawke) resonated with me.  Lots of conversation around taking risks and learning from failure.
* The Peter Attia episode of [Armchair Expert](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/peter-attia) was fantastic.  His story is amazing.

A quote that has me thinking:
> “We don’t abandon our pursuits because we despair of ever perfecting them.”
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.2.37b”

Music I enjoyed (I'll eventually learn how to embed Spotify):
* [Gojira: Remembrance](https://open.spotify.com/track/1RDLNfVzB0CbmAtBaj0VCM?si=bd40b0a732e442e2)
* [Bring Me the Horizon:  Parasite Eve](https://open.spotify.com/track/36xBFaVGjqm7le8CTHytUj?si=8b28c8eff48f47af)
