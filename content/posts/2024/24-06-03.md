I sometimes catch myself thinking if I just had X then Y would happen.  I tried this when I picked up the guitar again during the pandemic.
The equipment and amp sims that I purchased were more than enough for what I wanted to do, but it didn't sound quite the way I wanted.  I was spoiled by the good audio mixes you hear on guitar youtube and I figured I could buy my way out of not practicing.  The reason I sounded bad was because my playing was bad.  String noise, poor muting were the problem, not the equipment.  Just practice.

Similar with exercise; it doesn't need to be perfect, just move and work with what you have.  The basics are always good enough; compound pushes and pulls.  Don't overthink it.
