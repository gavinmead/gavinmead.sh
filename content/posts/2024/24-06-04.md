Systems are important to drive identity changes; James Clear taught me that.  In particular, I did not sleep well last night.  I slept in so I was not as tired.  When that happens I tend to get restless.  I made the conscious choice to force myself awake at 5am (my goal wake up time) no matter what time I fell asleep (it was around 1am).  It would have two benefits.  First, I'd get back to my morning routine, and two, I'm pretty tired right now, so confidence is high that I'll sleep better.  It sucked, but I'm glad I did it.  It's always easier to hit the snooze button or in my case, I just turn it off and go back to bed.  But, when I hold myself to a standard and I care about meeting it, that makes all of the difference.  I wasn't even that tired when I woke up this morning...â˜• helps.
