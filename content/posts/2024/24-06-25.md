Sometimes you have to drive hard and get knocked around.  You could take serious contact and not get help, but sometimes it is necessary.  It is sometimes necessary to disrupt and shake things up.  It isn't comfortable or fun and can get you into trouble, but sometimes it is worth it.  Even though this is a basketball analogy, perhaps a hockey fight is more apt.  Players may decide to fight to help amp up their team.  It isn't fun, but it can help get the overall job done.
