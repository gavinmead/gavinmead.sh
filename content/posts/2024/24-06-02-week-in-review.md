### Podcasts I enjoyed

* The Tim Ferriss two for one episodes have been great.  This one stuck out: [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2024/05/29/jim-collins-and-ed-zschau/).  Zschau's story is remarkable and Collins system for tracking creativity is pretty cool.
* [The Rich Roll Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/podcast/roll-on-837/).  Roll On is always fun.

### C++ Updates

Mostly the same as last week, but did some practice with [googletest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for mocking.  Finished a few of the Build Your Own Redis on [codeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) in addition to some updates to gm-git.  The flag parsing work in gm-git has been really fun, but admittedly a bit of a side-quest for code organization between .h and .cpp files.  

### Curiosity Updates

The rucking backpack showed up and I've done 3 walks so far and it has been great.  As life permits the aim will be to average 2 miles per walk with an occasional 3 mile walk.

Started looking at [nix](https://nixos.org/); mainly because of work, but also as something to explore for fun. 

Also started looking at [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) based on this great talk
