Guiding and helping other people is pretty great and something that I've grown into over the last few years.  I never thought of myself as a leader and was quite reluctant to embrace that as a thing that mattered.  But, I have found that helping others, especially teaching has been incredibly rewarding and I am always so happy when I see people grow.
