### Podcasts I enjoyed

Limited podcast time this week
* [The Rich Roll Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/podcast/sam-harris-838/) with Sam Harris was interesting.

### C++ Updates

Mostly video watching this week; learning about the rule of 5 and weak pointers.  I did a little work on gm-git focused on the builder pattern.  It provided more practice with move semantics and has been great learning so far.

### Curiosity Updates

Rucking walks have been good; doing about 1.5 miles.  I did 3.6 yesterday and that was pretty challenging towards the end; proabably the right space for which to work for the next few months.
