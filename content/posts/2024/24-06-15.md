I don't use social media other than LinkedIn and rarely do I share anything.  I'll like things that others share, but I am generally quite reticient.  I don't know where that comes from other than a fear of something.  Probably criticism.  But that is something that I am working on.  I wanted to share an experience I had after going for a walk at my alma-mater George Mason University.  I spent too much time on it, but it was also a good writing exercise and I'm glad I did it.  I was reminded of a quote from Steven Bartlett, don't self-reject.  Take some chances...
