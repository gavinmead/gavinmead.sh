I have wanted to run a website for a bit to capture fun things that I am up to.  I was inspired listening to "The Tim Ferriss Show" with Derek Sivers [episode](https://tim.blog/2023/04/21/derek-sivers/).  In particular, I thought it was super cool the way Sivers achieves [tech independence](https://sive.rs/ti) and decided to give it a try.

This site may be nothing or something, but I want to share things I'm learning and practice my writing.
