# gm-git


### Idea

I am relearning C++ and writing a git clone as a means of doing so.

It will not be a full working git clone.  It is will implement a subset of commands for fun.  The primary goal is learning through something practical.  Items are hoping to learn:
* bazel as a build tool
* CLion as an IDE
* Interesting things from later versions of C++; it's been a minute since I used it
* Using libraries like googletest
* Cross platform builds for Mac and Linux
