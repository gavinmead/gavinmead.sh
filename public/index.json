I want to do something similar to the Tim Ferriss 5 Bullet Friday where I share stuff that I found interesting this past week. Podcasts I enjoyed: The Tim Ferriss Show episode with Dustin Moskovitz. I‚Äôm playing around with the time budget google sheet template. The Ethan Hawke episode of Armchair Expert resonated with me. Lots of conversation around taking risks and learning from failure. The Peter Attia episode of Armchair Expert was fantastic. His story is amazing.
