Depending on the your outlook, the past can be a reminder of success and failure; regrets maybe, what might have been. The latter is okay if you don’t dwell on it. This can become difficult if the regrets pile up. But, like every motivational video or blog post in existence, look forward. It’s better that way. Use the past as a mechanism to learn and to smile.

I have some staples that are good and I’ve made modifications to them over the years, but I started a tradition last year that involved the weekend of my birthday crafting a meal that I don’t normally do. Last year it was the spaghetti from The Chef Show on Netflix. It was a lot of fun and really difficult. This year it’s hamburgers. Like, really trying to making something that tasted amazing. I studied YouTube channels and got some advice from a co-worker of mine who ultimately convinced me to use a griddle or cast iron pan. I didn’t do exactly what he recommended (smashburgers), but they turned out quite well. What does this have to do with practice? It a committment to doing something well even when you aren’t good at it. It is being coachable and open to feedback; trusting in others.

In particular, I did not sleep well last night. I slept in so I was not as tired. When that happens I tend to get restless. I made the conscious choice to force myself awake at 5am (my goal wake up time) no matter what time I fell asleep (it was around 1am). It would have two benefits. First, I’d get back to my morning routine, and two, I’m pretty tired right now, so confidence is high that I’ll sleep better. It sucked, but I’m glad I did it. It’s always easier to hit the snooze button or in my case, I just turn it off and go back to bed. But, when I hold myself to a standard and I care about meeting it, that makes all of the difference. I wasn’t even that tired when I woke up this morning…☕ helps.

I tried this when I picked up the guitar again during the pandemic. The equipment and amp sims that I purchased were more than enough for what I wanted to do, but it didn’t sound quite the way I wanted. I was spoiled by the good audio mixes you hear on guitar youtube and I figured I could buy my way out of not practicing. The reason I sounded bad was because my playing was bad. String noise, poor muting were the problem, not the equipment. Just practice. Similar with exercise; it doesn’t need to be perfect, just move and work with what you have. The basics are always good enough; compound pushes and pulls. Don’t overthink it.

Focusing on the important questions is a matter of high judgement with some intuition about the questions weight. This too can lead to a doom loop. Sometimes it is best to just go for it.

Then I heard a similar thing in an interview with Seth Godin where he commits to writing everyday. It doesn’t have to be his best work, but he commits to doing it. I think that is super cool. I don’t know that I have a ton to say, but there are a few things I want to do with consistency: Write code everyday; re-learning C++ now. Write ‘something’ everyday for this site.
