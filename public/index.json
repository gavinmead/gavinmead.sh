[{"categories":["life"],"content":"I am on a general search for balance and consistency. I was listening a few months ago to an episode of The Tim Ferriss Show that talked about slow productivity. I am going to give it another listen, but something that stuck with me was the consistency of practice. I heard it but it didn’t click. Then I heard a similar thing in an interview with Seth Godin where he commits to writing everyday. It doesn’t have to be his best work, but he commits to doing it. I think that is super cool. I don’t know that I have a ton to say, but there are a few things I want to do with consistency: Write code everyday; re-learning C++ now. Write ‘something’ everyday for this site. Share projects that I am working whether they be technology, music or cooking.

It will not be a full working git clone. It is will implement a subset of commands for fun. The primary goal is learning through something practical. Items are hoping to learn: bazel as a build tool CLion as an IDE Interesting things from later versions of C++; it’s been a minute since I used it Using libraries like googletest Cross platform builds for Mac and Linux ","date":"2024-05-28","objectID":"/gm-git/:0:1","tags":["technology"],"title":"gm-git","uri":"/gm-git/"},{"categories":["life"],"content":"Enjoyed a week of relaxation at the beach. I want to do something similar to the Tim Ferriss 5 Bullet Friday where I share stuff that I found interesting this past week. Podcasts I enjoyed: The Tim Ferriss Show episode with Dustin Moskovitz. I’m playing around with the time budget google sheet template. The Ethan Hawke episode of Armchair Expert resonated with me. Lots of conversation around taking risks and learning from failure. The Peter Attia episode of Armchair Expert was fantastic. His story is amazing. A quote that has me thinking: “We don’t abandon our pursuits because we despair of ever perfecting them.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.2.37b” Music I enjoyed (I’ll eventually learn how to embed Spotify): Gojira: Remembrance Bring Me the Horizon: Parasite Eve Cool Videos I watched: ","date":"2023-08-13","objectID":"/8_6_week_review/:0:0","tags":["life"],"title":"August 6th Week In Review","uri":"/8_6_week_review/"},{"categories":null,"content":"I am software engineer by trade with 14 years of progressive experience and 20+ years of information technology experience overall.
