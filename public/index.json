[{"categories":["life"],"content":"Sometimes the best course of action is to just move. Not a particularly deep thought, but for those of us that can get caught up in our own heads, it is a good reminder. It is easy to fall into the doom loop of questioning everything; imagining every possible outcome. “What about this…what about that”? This is probably not the best use of time. Focusing on the important questions is a matter of high judgement with some intuition about the questions weight. This too can lead to a doom loop. Sometimes it is best to just go for it.

Heavy deadlifts at 5:45am in the morning is not as easy. The excuses and justifcations for why you cannot or should not do it start to creep in, but in reality like many things, we suffer more in imagination than reality. Always do the first set; especially when you don’t want to. That’s the point.

Right now I am prioritizing slow productivity in my personal life; focusing on consistent exercise, learning C++ and updating this site. I notice that other things that I thought I cared about have fallen away. At work, it is building a customer experience for a platform I support. I find that I truly care about making something that works for people, it is energizing. The craftsmanship of customer first is a lot of fun.

I was listening a few months ago to an episode of The Tim Ferriss Show that talked about slow productivity. I am going to give it another listen, but something that stuck with me was the consistency of practice. I heard it but it didn’t click. Then I heard a similar thing in an interview with Seth Godin where he commits to writing everyday. It doesn’t have to be his best work, but he commits to doing it. I think that is super cool. I don’t know that I have a ton to say, but there are a few things I want to do with consistency: Write code everyday; re-learning C++ now. Write ‘something’ everyday for this site. Share projects that I am working whether they be technology, music or cooking.

I was playing around with a Flag interface and some of the templating seemed weird. If I want to do that then fixing the bazel build is the next thing. It looks like the cc_toolchain defaults to c++14, and I’ll need at least c++17 (23 is ideal) in order to explore that more.

It could be interesting to do some templates like the item below for a set of simple types like bools, ints, floats, strings (at least to start).
