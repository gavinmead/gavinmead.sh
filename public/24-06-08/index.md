# Past Tense


Reflections on your past can be fun or angsty; probably both.  Depending on the your outlook, the past can be a reminder of success and failure; regrets maybe, what might have been.  The latter is okay if you don't dwell on it.  This can become difficult if the regrets pile up.  But, like every motivational video or blog post in existence, look forward. It's better that way.  Use the past as a mechanism to learn and to smile.
