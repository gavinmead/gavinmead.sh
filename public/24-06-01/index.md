# Bias Towards Action


Sometimes the best course of action is to just move.  Not a particularly deep thought, but for those of us that can get caught up in our
own heads, it is a good reminder.  

It is easy to fall into the doom loop of questioning everything; imagining every possible outcome. "What about this...what about that"?  This is probably not the best use of time.  Focusing on the important questions is a matter of high judgement with some intuition about the questions weight.  This too can lead to a doom loop.  Sometimes it is best to just go for it.
