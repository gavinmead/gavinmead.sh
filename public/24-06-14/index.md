# Under the wire


A bit of a crazy day, but still trying to maintain the habit of a daily post.

I visited my old my university today.  I'll probably write more about that another day.  I just took a walk while my son had soccer practice.  I thought about good (and bad) memories, but really how the course of my life changed though chance encounters and making connections with people during my time there.
