# May 26-June 1 Week in Review


A delightful week of slow productivity.  A few fun things to share.

### Podcasts I enjoyed
* [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2024/05/21/brene-brown-ed-thorp/) two for one with Brene Brown and Edward O. Thorp.
* [The Rich Roll Podcast](https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dan-churchill-833/) with Dan Churchill.  Technically, I listened to this last week, but wanted to share.

### Resources I've been using for C++

### Things that have me curious

* [Rucking](https://www.strongfirst.com/how-to-ruck/) as a means of improving my health.  I am not a runner and while I like walking, I'd like to get more out of it.  I have a [rucking backpack](https://www.goruck.com/pages/start-rucking) being delivered this week so I look forward to trying it out.
* [Velox](https://velox-lib.io/) from Meta looks like an interesting project.  I have long wanted to find an open source project to work on and this one looks awesome.  It has motivated a big part of the C++ learning.  I have a weird bet that more efficient and performant data processing will be required for competitive advantage in the AI/ML age.
