# 2048 Agent


I started playing 2048 this year as means to kill time when I am bored.  I'd like to channel this boredom into something productive.  I've been watching this [PyTorch introduction series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_lsbAsL_o2CTlGHgMxNrKhzP97BaG9ZN)

### Idea

The idea is to develop an agent that will learn how to play 2048.

### Approach

The approach will be fun because I have **no** idea what I am doing :grinning:.  I'll have a dedicated section to the approach in a future post
