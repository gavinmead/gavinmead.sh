    <description><![CDATA[Podcasts I enjoyed Limited podcast time this week
The Rich Roll Podcast with Sam Harris was interesting. C++ Updates Mostly video watching this week; learning about the rule of 5 and weak pointers. I did a little work on gm-git focused on the builder pattern. It provided more practice with move semantics and has been great learning so far.
Curiosity Updates Rucking walks have been good; doing about 1.5 miles. I did 3.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I don&rsquo;t use social media other than LinkedIn and rarely do I share anything. I&rsquo;ll like things that others share, but I am generally quite reticient. I don&rsquo;t know where that comes from other than a fear of something. Probably criticism. But that is something that I am working on. I wanted to share an experience I had after going for a walk at my alma-mater George Mason University. I spent too much time on it, but it was also a good writing exercise and I&rsquo;m glad I did it.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A bit of a crazy day, but still trying to maintain the habit of a daily post.
I visited my old my university today. I&rsquo;ll probably write more about that another day. I just took a walk while my son had soccer practice. I thought about good (and bad) memories, but really how the course of my life changed though chance encounters and making connections with people during my time there.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Sometimes a break in an expectation can lead to great results. It helps you challenge assumptions about what comes next and keeps you engaged. Rhythm is important, but every now and then it is fun to change things up.]]></description>

    <title>Create a new homeostasis</title>

    <description><![CDATA[When I try to grow there is an inevitable pull towards a previous homestasis that is difficult to push through sometimes. I&rsquo;m catching myself now. I have a decent amount of professional work to do that I am excited for, but I can already feel it creeping into my other interests of slow productivity. This is to be fought since the work will always be there. Spending an hour on important things does not make or break anything with the work that will be waiting for you.]]></description>

    <title>Gratitude</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Gratitude is a nice way to start or end any day. It is useful at the end; especially if the day was less than ideal because it will shift you towards something positive. It is a common practice as a prompt for daily journaling. I have a section for gratitude in my morning pages template, but, I don&rsquo;t always follow it. It says &ldquo;I am grateful for&rdquo; and then I list some things.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Focus on the things that matter to you and find opportunities to cut out noise. As I&rsquo;ve gotten older the only thing that really matters to me is my time. But, I am not always so great at utilizing my time as wisely as I could. This happens because it is difficult to say no or my curiousity gets the better of me instead of staying focused on a few things.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Podcasts I enjoyed The Tim Ferriss two for one episodes have been great. This one stuck out: The Tim Ferriss Show. Zschau&rsquo;s story is remarkable and Collins system for tracking creativity is pretty cool. The Rich Roll Podcast. Roll On is always fun. C++ Updates Mostly the same as last week, but did some practice with googletest for mocking. Finished a few of the Build Your Own Redis on codeCrafters in addition to some updates to gm-git.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Reflections on your past can be fun or angsty; probably both. Depending on the your outlook, the past can be a reminder of success and failure; regrets maybe, what might have been. The latter is okay if you don&rsquo;t dwell on it. This can become difficult if the regrets pile up. But, like every motivational video or blog post in existence, look forward. It&rsquo;s better that way. Use the past as a mechanism to learn and to smile.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Cooking is something I love and I&rsquo;m not terribly good at it. I have some staples that are good and I&rsquo;ve made modifications to them over the years, but I started a tradition last year that involved the weekend of my birthday crafting a meal that I don&rsquo;t normally do. Last year it was the spaghetti from The Chef Show on Netflix. It was a lot of fun and really difficult.]]></description>
