    <description><![CDATA[Enjoyed a week of relaxation at the beach. I want to do something similar to the Tim Ferriss 5 Bullet Friday where I share stuff that I found interesting this past week.
Podcasts I enjoyed:
The Tim Ferriss Show episode with Dustin Moskovitz. I&rsquo;m playing around with the time budget google sheet template. The Ethan Hawke episode of Armchair Expert resonated with me. Lots of conversation around taking risks and learning from failure.]]></description>
