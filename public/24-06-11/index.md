# Gratitude


Gratitude is a nice way to start or end any day.  It is useful at the end; especially if the day was less than ideal because it will shift you towards something positive.  It is a common practice as a prompt for daily journaling.  I have a section for gratitude in my morning pages template, but, I don't always follow it.  It says "I am grateful for" and then I list some things.  It can be anything from any facet of life.  For example, I am grateful that I can play the guitar and be creative; easy stuff.
