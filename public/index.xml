    <description><![CDATA[I am on a general search for balance and consistency. I was listening a few months ago to an episode of The Tim Ferriss Show that talked about slow productivity. I am going to give it another listen, but something that stuck with me was the consistency of practice. I heard it but it didn&rsquo;t click. Then I heard a similar thing in an interview with Seth Godin where he commits to writing everyday.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Idea I am relearning C++ and writing a git clone as a means of doing so.
It will not be a full working git clone. It is will implement a subset of commands for fun. The primary goal is learning through something practical. Items are hoping to learn:
bazel as a build tool CLion as an IDE Interesting things from later versions of C++; it&rsquo;s been a minute since I used it Using libraries like googletest Cross platform builds for Mac and Linux ]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Enjoyed a week of relaxation at the beach. I want to do something similar to the Tim Ferriss 5 Bullet Friday where I share stuff that I found interesting this past week.
Podcasts I enjoyed:
The Tim Ferriss Show episode with Dustin Moskovitz. I&rsquo;m playing around with the time budget google sheet template. The Ethan Hawke episode of Armchair Expert resonated with me. Lots of conversation around taking risks and learning from failure.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have wanted to run a website for a bit to capture fun things that I am up to. I was inspired listening to &ldquo;The Tim Ferriss Show&rdquo; with Derek Sivers episode. In particular, I thought it was super cool the way Sivers achieves tech independence and decided to give it a try.
This site may be nothing or something, but I want to share things I&rsquo;m learning and practice my writing.]]></description>
