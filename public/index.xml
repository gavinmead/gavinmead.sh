    <description><![CDATA[I started playing 2048 this year as means to kill time when I am bored. I&rsquo;d like to channel this boredom into something productive. I&rsquo;ve been watching this PyTorch introduction series
Example Video Idea The idea is to develop an agent that will learn how to play 2048.
Approach The approach will be fun because I have no idea what I am doing ðŸ˜€. I&rsquo;ll have a dedicated section to the approach in a future post]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have wanted to run a website for a bit to capture fun things that I am up to. I was inspired listening to &ldquo;The Tim Ferriss Show&rdquo; with Derek Sivers episode. In particular, I thought it was super cool the way Sivers achieves tech independence and decided to give it a try.
This site may be nothing or something, but I want to share things I&rsquo;m learning and practice my writing.]]></description>
