# Create a new homeostasis


When I try to grow there is an inevitable pull towards a previous homestasis that is difficult to push through sometimes.  I'm catching myself now.  I have a decent amount of professional work to do that I am excited for, but I can already feel it creeping into my other interests of slow productivity.  This is to be fought since the work will always be there.  Spending an hour on important things does not make or break anything with the work that will be waiting for you.  

Prioritize what you care about, but don't let new things immediately mess up the hard work you put into other areas; especially if that work is not done.  A co-worker of mine has a slack bubble that says "One thing at a time, the most important thing first".  It is a great reminder and sometimes the most important thing is to push towards new limits so that when an inevitable homeostasis does occur, it will feel new and then you can push towards another positive one.
