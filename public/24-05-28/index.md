# Slow Productivity


I am on a general search for balance and consistency.  I was listening a few months ago to an episode of [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2022/02/02/cal-newport/) that talked about slow productivity.  I am going to give it another listen, but something that stuck with me was the consistency of practice.  I heard it but it didn't click.  Then I heard a similar thing in an interview with Seth Godin where he commits to writing everyday.  It doesn't have to be his best work, but he commits to doing it.  I think that is super cool.  

I don't know that I have a ton to say, but there are a few things I want to do with consistency:
* Write code everyday; re-learning C++ now.
* Write 'something' everyday for this site.  
* Share projects that I am working whether they be technology, music or cooking.
