# Tradeoffs


Focus on the things that matter to you and find opportunities to cut out noise.  As I've gotten older the only thing that really matters to me is my time.  But, I am not always so great at utilizing my time as wisely as I could.  This happens because it is difficult to say no or my curiousity gets the better of me instead of staying focused on a few things.  It can sometimes feel like you have to make tradeoffs, but in my experience most of the things involved in the tradeoff probably weren't that important to begin with.  They were important for a time, but they don't have to stay that way.  Let them fade away, if they bubble up again, cool.
