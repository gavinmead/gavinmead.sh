# Marathons


Sometimes deep work can be a ton of fun.  Especially when you reach a flow state.  I don't celebrate this, but I was having a hard time sleeping so decided to wake up to do some work (for the job, not C++).  I found myself being incredibly productive and thus completely lost track of time.  All told, I looked up at and it was 4am.  I wasn't tired, in fact, I was quite energized.  Sometimes, deep work can really be so rewarding, especially when you hit some quick wins and some problems.  I hit a problem and unfortunately for me that can sometimes result in a rabbit hole and a sincere desire to solve it before stopping.  Luckily, this problem got figured out, but admittedly, 4am is not sustainable, but an occasional marathon is fun.
