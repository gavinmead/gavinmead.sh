# Embrace Imposter Syndrome


Imposter syndrome does not have to be a bad thing.  It is something that can keep you sharp and is a forcing function for growth.  It is not always pleasant, but when used well you can do some great things.  Additionally, if you have a seat at the table; especially if you've been invited, you are there for a reason, embrace it, take some risks and get invited to the next table.  You'll repeat the process all over again.  Enjoy it.
